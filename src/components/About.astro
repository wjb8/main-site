          <p>
            I'm a freelance web developer with over 5 years of experience
            building modern, performant websites and applications. I specialize
            in using Astro and React to create fast, accessible web experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach combines clean code, thoughtful design, and a focus on
            performance. I believe in building websites that not only look great
            but also provide an excellent user experience across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new web technologies,
            contributing to open source, or sharing what I've learned through
            writing and mentoring.
